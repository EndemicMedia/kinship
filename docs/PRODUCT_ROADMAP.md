## Current Delivery Scope: Frontend Showcase

Kinship currently targets a frontend-only mock website that demonstrates the
displayed features. Real accounts, real data, backend services, and external
integrations are outside this delivery scope. The production requirements below
remain a long-term specification, not a checklist of capabilities already shipped.

### Completed showcase milestones

- [x] Seeded-persona login, session restoration, switching, and logout.
- [x] Persona-specific profile editing and locally saved notification/privacy preferences.
- [x] Compass filtering, compatibility breakdowns, votes/reset, local message history,
  and pending connection requests.
- [x] Crew creation, discovery, joining/requesting membership, chat, and attachment-name previews.
- [x] Crew values, incident responses/status changes, check-in scheduling, and submission.
- [x] Crew-linked template drafts, document editing, signing, reopening, and text downloads.
- [x] Search commands, notification destinations, activity links, theme controls,
  and keyboard-accessible navigation/sidebar controls.
- [x] Landing navigation and informational dialogs; English, German, and Portuguese
  content with locale-preserving app navigation.
- [x] Mobile/tablet/desktop behavioral tests, WebKit smoke coverage, unit tests,
  type checking, translation checks, and local image validation.
- [x] Static export with client-only app deep links and validation-gated Pages deployment.

Mock messages and signatures do not contact other people or execute agreements.
Password changes and account deletion demonstrate cancellable workflows without
changing a real account. Attachment previews do not upload files.
Profile overrides and preferences persist locally; crew and Compass changes
are session-local and are not durable backend records.

### Next showcase priorities

1. Keep behavioral coverage aligned with every new displayed control and route;
   include narrow-screen, keyboard, locale, and static-export checks.
2. Extend accessibility checks for focus order, contrast, and assistive-technology
   announcements beyond the current interaction tests.
3. Exercise malformed or unavailable browser storage and interrupted mock actions
   to strengthen recovery behavior.
4. Add further product journeys from this specification only when intentionally
   added to the showcase; implement them with mock state unless scope changes.

These priorities are follow-up work, not unfinished items from the completed
showcase milestone. Production authentication, identity verification, payments,
medical/legal integrations, and backend persistence require a separate delivery
decision before implementation.

See [interaction contracts](../BUTTON_AUDIT.md) for observable behavior and
[setup and validation](../README.md) for local and static test commands.

### Integration Resilience

| Pattern | Implementation | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Circuit Breaker** | Hystrix or similar, fail after 5 errors | Prevent cascade failures |
| **Retry with Backoff** | Exponential backoff, max 3 retries | Handle transient errors |
| **Timeout** | 10s for API calls, 30s for documents | Prevent hanging |
| **Fallback** | Graceful degradation, queue for later | Maintain availability |
| **Rate Limiting** | Per-integration limits, tracking | Stay within quotas |
| **Webhook Verification** | Signature validation, replay prevention | Security |
| **Idempotency** | Idempotency keys, deduplication | Prevent duplicates |
